Wobbly City At Sea is a game about trying to balance this small island that's barely supported by the rock it's sitting on top of. With every new building placed on top of it the, the change it weight causes the island to swing widely back and forth, so your job is so manage the weight as to not have it tip too far and fall into the ocean. It's short, cute, stressful, and easy to pick up, and all the while you've got some jams in background to keep you company. Go give it a play now! The link to do so is just above.  

Wobbly City At Sea was developed over 48 hours as a part of the Ludum Dare 49 Compo, the more restrictive version of the event cutting off 24 hours from the regular jam and forcing you to create everything yourself: code, art and music. It took some design planning talks with a friend, working on art working downtime at my job, and some late nights, but by the end of it all what you see here is what I managed to pull together. For how rough some of the edges are, I think the game is surprisingly playable and actually kind of fun, so I'd say that the event was a big success, at least for me personally. It was also the start of my first Devtober, a personal challenge to work on a project in some capacity every day that I'm looking forward to continuing the rest of this October. I've already learned a lot and got to stretch my game development brain again, so I'm looking forward to see what comes next for me this month!
