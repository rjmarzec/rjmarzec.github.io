Quiet In The Deep is an action stealth game about finding treasure in the ocean while avoiding all the scary sea creatures that live well below the waters. While most stealth games are more about careful planning over execution, Quiet In The Deep tries to spice things up by tying your movement speed to the amount of sound you're making, which leads to a lot of interesting gameplay situations. Do you swim real fast to jet past that shark and alert them in the process, or can you take it slow to sneak past without drawing their attention? Combine that with a unique control scheme that feels like paddling, and you've got a cool page of a game.  

Quiet In The Deep was a project developed in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 48 game jam, which landed just before finals during the second semester of my sophomore year. After some brainstorming on the theme of 'deeper and deeper,' me and my partner landed on the idea of deep water diving for treasure, and we got to work in Unity. The project was a lot of fun since my partner, Chris Monteferrante, was someone who graduated and was working professionally as a game developer at the time! I got see how someone with way more experience went about writing scripts and organizing the project neatly compared to my ham-fisted approaches when throwing together projects in Unity before. Because I still had work and some leftover assignments I couldn't quite put all of my time during the week into the project to match my partner, but by the end I think I managed to get my fair share in with putting together all the art for the game, programming in the alternating click movement and lighting, and designing a bunch of the levels.
