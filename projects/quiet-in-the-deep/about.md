Quiet In The Deep is an action stealth game about finding treasure in the ocean while avoiding all the scary sea creatures that live well below the waters. While most stealth games are more about careful planning over execution, Quiet In The Deep tries to spice things up by tying your movement speed to the amount of sound you're making, which leads to a lot of interesting gameplay situations. Do you swim real fast to jet past that shark and alert them in the process, or can you take it slow to sneak past without drawing their attention? Combine that with a unique control scheme that feels like paddling, and you've got a cool page of a game.  

Quiet In The Deep was a project developed in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 48 game jam. After some brainstorming on the theme of 'deeper and deeper,' me and my partner landed on the idea of deep water diving for treasure.
