title: The end of Ludum Dare 49
---

And after only 3 short blog posts, we're at the end of Ludum Dare 49 and my write-ups here. It's *real* sad, but that means I get all my free time back and can move onto some more fun smaller projects. Woo!  

Like I mentioned at the end of the previous post, today was about lots of wrap up for the game. I threw together some music using a bunch of free loops on [BandLab](https://www.bandlab.com/rjmarzec/new-project-37917ada?revId=578ef768-9524-ec11-981f-a04a5e798978), added in some visual stuff like moving waves & zooming camera, and the rest of the time was bugfixing and balancing to get the game to feel *juuust* right.  

I ran into some issues uploading my code to github because it was angry about some larger files and the web build breaking, but I manage to get everything in with a finished game! If you're looking to check out the game, see the links below:

By the end of it, I'm pretty proud of where I got! I found myself "testing" the game a fun excuse to time some time not working on the project after hours of grinding, and the stress of seeing the island tip back and forth is pretty fun. As with all game jam games it has a lot of rough edges, but that's the fun of throwing together a game on your own. Hopefully you get the chance to try it out and see that I'm saying too!  

Lastly, here's a gif of the final gameplay I threw together for social media, but the non-compressed version because I actually have the file size support on this site. Neat!

That's all for now, so see you tomorrow with some much calmer work!
