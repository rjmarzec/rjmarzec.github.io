title: The last day for audio
---

And just like that, today is the last day of Devtober! It's been a long journey to get here, and by the end of it I've got some sort of working game despite all the ups and downs over the month. The game still has a bit of work to do before it's ready to send off, but from here it's just some small fixes and rounding some edges - stuff that won't take super long and isn't terribly exciting.  

Still, just because we're at the end today doesn't mean the work finished up yesterday!! Today I finished up the one small feature every game needs: audio! [sfxr.me](sfxr.me) is my favorite site for small stuff like this, so now I've got some blips and beeps for attacks, heals, and round end sounds.
