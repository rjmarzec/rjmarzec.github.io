title: Some new enemy models
---

Just having a single robot to beat up in game isn't super exciting, so today I decided to concept some new enemy designs! Today we've got some round alien with crazy legs and a knife in hand, and on the other side we've got an angry meteor ready to slam into you while blazing red hot.  

Now, how exactly do these both fit in? No clue! They're vaguely space-themed and it's hard to justify how they're inside the space ship (well, the meteor at least), but I'm sure I'll figure out some way, and if not, they'll just be sticking around. Look out for them getting tossed into game tomorrow!
