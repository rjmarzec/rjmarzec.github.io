title: Meet the meteor
---

Since I couldn't figure out a fun way to animate the alien I threw together the other day, today I opted to get the meteor into the game instead! For now it's functionally the same as the robot, but it looks way cooler! Instead of just tilted back and forth, it bobs up and down while also constantly spinning. I also messed with the lighting a bit to make it feel more like a meteor I guess, but that could still use some polish since I probably need the back side of it lit as well for the full effect. Just don't ask why a meteor is in a space ship again.  

So, how do I plan on making it (and quite frankly, the robot as well) more interesting? Great question... I'll be sitting on that one as I warp up this small slice of a game, as I'll have to figure out how to answer it for the alien as well!
