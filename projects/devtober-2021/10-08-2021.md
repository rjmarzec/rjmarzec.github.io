title: Trying art styles - A streak of 3 days
---

We're back again with another round of concepting. I feel like I could be doing some more work on the programming end, but for right now that's where my brain's at and I've been a bit strapped for time between other obligations!  

Anyways, the below is what I've got today. I think out of these the card and bird might be options to keep trying moving forward. A card using cards in game sounds dumb enough to be interesting, plus you can do fun visuals with the front and back. Sort of same with the bird - there's a lot of goofy looks you can give it to make the artwork fun.  

So, expect more of the same tomorrow, but hopefully in more of a solid direction. :)

See you tomorrow,
