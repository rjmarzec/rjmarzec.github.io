title: Some simple UI updates
---

I decided to take it a bit easy today, so this time around I just updated the existing UI elements! We've got some new text backgrounds as well as greener health bars, and since now it matches the art style more than some Unity default sprites, it looks pretty nice. Now I've just got to figure out a font that fits everything better, and at least visually the game will be completely touched up.

See you tomorrow,
