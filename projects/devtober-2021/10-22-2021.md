title: Suddenly, a cave appears
---

While I'm sitting on what ideas I want to go further on for the core gameplay loop, I went back to some artwork! Today I tried out a cave/mine theme to fill out the background, and here are the results. It's fun and cartoony, but I think it could really use a second pass to clean it up and make it more clear. The shadows in game are also starting to noticeably act up, so that's also something I've got to attend to now...

See you tomorrow,
