title: Trying art styles - More random characters
---

Continuing a bit from yesterday, I went back to the *drawing* board to put together some new characters. A snowman, a crab, and I even brought back my old friend toaster boy in a new form. As always, I think they came out cute, but still nothing's really jumping out at me as something I want to really commit to as an art style, so it looks like we'll be back here again tomorrow making the rounds! Oh boy.

See you tomorrow,
