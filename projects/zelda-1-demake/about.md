Zelda 1 Demake is exactly what you expect: a remake of just the first dungeon of Zelda 1, but with 2 way less experienced programmers working Unity compared to a full team at Nintendo. It also didn't help that we had 3 weeks from start to finish! The project came about from a course assignment having us pair up to remake the dungeon, and then also add our own unique mechanic on a custom dungeon on top of it all. Me and my partner ultimately landed on an ice dungeon theme, featuring sliding puzzles and an ice wand that freezes enemies into pushable blocks. If it at all sounds interesting, I recommend giving it a look at the links above. Note that if you do download the project, you'll need to check out the on-site page for instructions anyways.  

For this project, the partnership was a nice split roughly down the middle, which we got to keep track of on a Kanban board. That Kanban that was baked into the project specifications was my first taste of what agile development is really like, and having it as a reference when working with my partner really boosted out productivity, which was awesome to have. As far as being Unity newcomers, that came with a lot of fun problems along the way, but thanks to taking a proper course and my time developing Bee Game on my own, we managed to get a mostly complete dungeon 1 working game. There's a bit of weirdness you'll notice and feel, but for the most part the recreation is fairly faithful, which is all we could for with the project. I will highly recommend checking out the special dungeon though! A lot of care went into making it, and I think it's fun. You can access it by hitting 4 once the game boots up.
