After being inspired by all the fun I had playing TFT, Bee Game was my attempt to capture the spirit of an auto-battler in a new form during early 2020. After some concepting, that idea turned into a game that is best described as PvP Plants vs Zombies, where both sides get to play the plants. Together, the package is a hectic time managing your resources and responding to what your opponents put down while working the (in hindsight) horrible control scheme.  

This project was developed all on my own over the course of a semester (freshman year semester 2, 2020)! What started out as a team of 4 working on the game as part of a club quickly dropped to just me working on the game week to week. On one hand that meant full control of what I was working on, but that was also 6 extra hands that could have been working on the project weren't there to help!  

For this being my first project in Unity and having to work on it all on my own inbetween other school work, I think it turned out just great! The visuals have got a lot of charm, and when playing against a friend matches can get intense. Balance might not be all there, but it shows promise for a PvP auto-battler in this style having some potential for lots of fun if expanded.
