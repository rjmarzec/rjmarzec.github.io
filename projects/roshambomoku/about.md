Inspired by a mentor's take on [crossing rock-paper-scissors with tic-tac-toe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peterbekos.rpsttt.free&hl=en_US&gl=US), Roshambomoku came out of the idea of crossing rock-paper-scissors with five-in-a-row for a local 1-on-1 strategy game. For a game that sounds simple at first, things can get pretty competitive with you and your opponent needing to think not only about where they want to move next, but also how piece replacement can get in the way of things.

I developed Roshambomoku during the start of 2021 during my winter break of my sophomore year all on my own. With a rush of inspiration, I built it from start to finish in just about 3 days before taking a break to slow down and polish stuff, but that meant it was the first app I've taken from start to finish in Flutter in spite of failed attempts before! It's certainly no game engine, but I managed to warp it into the vision I had in what I believe was a pretty final implementation. Since I was proud of what I had done, I also took it to the Google Play Store for publishing, where you can go download it now. That involved preparing the storefront materials, gameplay video, and privacy policy as well, which was all new and exciting for a first time publisher!
