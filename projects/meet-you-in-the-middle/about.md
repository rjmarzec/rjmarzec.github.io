Meet You In The Middle is a simple and lightweight tool that helps small groups find equitable meetup locations. Gone are the days of being unable to decide on meetup location with friends because everything is 'too far' from *someone*. Enter in any number of addresses, check out the map view, and you'll have the midpoint between all of them in front of you. From there, it's up to you to look around and pick out some place that looks fun.  

I developed Meet You In The Middle during early 2021 (sophomore year semester 2) as a fun side-project between classes. The idea is actually one I've built and iterated on before a few time to various level of success, but this was the first time I took it all the way through and published it. As my second published app in Flutter (despite being the first app I *tried* to build in Flutter), I learned a lot about how useful well-organized code is and how to use an awesome framework that I'm ready to toss into another project when my next great app idea comes to mind.

If you're looking for a simple tool to help you coordinate meetups with friends, give it a download and join the other 1,000+ that already have!
