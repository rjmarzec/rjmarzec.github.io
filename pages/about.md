#### Hi there!  

I'm Robert Marzec, and this is my website! Here you'll find a portfolio of my past projects, my resume, and a bit about me.  

I'm currently a Senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business and Music at the University of Michigan. I love cats, games, and building awesome experiences for people. Between weird game jam entries and random mobile tools, I've done a lot of cool stuff that you can find here!  

If you're looking for a software developer who doesn't take himself too seriously and comes bundled with lots of fun ideas, you've come to the right site. While we're at it, here's a fun picture of me with a smoothie:
