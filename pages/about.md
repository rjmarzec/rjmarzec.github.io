Hi there!  

I'm Robert Marzec, and welcome to my website. I'm a Junior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan, and I love crafting tools and experiences for others to enjoy. Between wacky hackathon games testing dumb ideas to mobile app tools I've published to a substantive number of downloads, I've done a lot of cool things with my skills.  

If you're looking for a software developer that doesn't take himself all too serious and has lots of fun ideas, you've come to the right site. Feel free to click around and check out some of my previous projects and resume if that interests you.
