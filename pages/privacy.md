# Terms and Privacy Policy
The privacy of my users is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.

## Mobile Apps and Games Privacy Policy

rjmarzec Apps and Games don't store your data, period. Most have no internet functionality, and thus have no way of sending that information even if they did. The sole exception is [Meet You In The Middle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rjmarzec.meet_you_in_the_middle&hl=en_US&gl=US), which requests your current location for some optional app functionality, but still does not retain any information about users. Feel free to check out the open-source project [here](https://github.com/rjmarzec/meet_you_in_the_middle) if you would like to see more about how the app processes that information.  

If you have questions, please contact me at <robertmarzecj@gmail.com>.
