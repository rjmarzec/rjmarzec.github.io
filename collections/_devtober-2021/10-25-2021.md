title: An evil robot
---

A cupcake fighting another cupcake that is dyed red with 2 swords in hand doesn't make a *ton* of sense in space, so today I went ahead and fixed that! Every abandoned space station needs an evil/rogue robot, so now this one has one too! I think it fits nicely into the rest of the theme and art style, and fixing the pivot to have it move around the wheel was also a nice touch I think.  

I also figured out how to fix up the lighting of the attacks, so now they're not effected by the lighting in the scene like before. Now they're nice an visible, regardless of where the light is pointing in the scene! A simple change, but one that has helped out visibility a ton!
