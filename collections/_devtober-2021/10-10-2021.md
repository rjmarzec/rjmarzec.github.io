title: A cupcake is emerges
---

With a nice cupcake put together after yesterday, today I opted to actually put it into game!  

Bringing in assets is nothing that takes super long, so I threw together some simple animations on top - some bobbing and goes faster with moment and a blinking cupcake over time. Again, nothing super intensive, but it adds a surprising amount of life to the character. Granted, we've got some problems since the character can't actually move *that* much during play in a card game there, so this is more concept that content.  

Anyways, enjoy the gif as usual!
