title: A cupcake is emerges
---

Yup, we've back on concepting some art today, but this time with progress!  

It was my birthday today, so with celebration on the mind, I *whipped together* a cupcake, and honestly, I love the results! A cupcake is really easy to draw, would look funny trying to fight, and using it to build a baking-themed card game sounds like a lot of fun!  

For now, I think I'm ready to move past concepting and back onto the real programming work. Granted, I've got a busy school week ahead of me so maybe I'll probably still be quickly throwing together artwork for a few more days. A decent bit into October, the game should starting to take form soon!
