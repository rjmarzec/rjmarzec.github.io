title: Spooky Space!
---

I liked the space theme from yesterday a lot, so today I tried actually bringing it into the game, plus a bit of extra spice. A moving space background and some touched up lighting later, and now we've getting somewhere! All together this looks like a spooky space theme that could actually end up somewhere!

See you tomorrow,
