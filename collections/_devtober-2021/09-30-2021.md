title: The Calm Before the Storm

Hi there!

All great months have to start somewhere, and for this October I want to break out of my routine to get back to working on fun ideas.  

With school back in full force it's easy to waste away time relaxing between assignments, but I perform best under the pressure of having too much interesting work to do. So, when I came across [Devtober 2021 on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/devtober-2021), I knew it was something I wanted to jump on. I took today to mentally prepare and get this page of my site set up for what will hopefully be 31 other daily posts, so tomorrow should mark the start of something memorable.  

If you're reading this at some point after the month is over, I hope you have a fun time looking over the progress I've made here day-by-day! If I've done my job right, you'll have lots of cool visuals to catch your eye as you scroll through.

That's all for now, so I'll be seeing you tomorrow!  
-Robert
