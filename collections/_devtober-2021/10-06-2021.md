title: Trying art styles - Mafia Foodstuffs
---

All game needs an art style/theme to guide it, so today I decided to mess around and play with some new ideas. Today, that meant drawing up an angry mobster carrot and banana! I feel like there's something here with the idea, but it might need to bake some more and be something I come back to down the line. It is an idea dumb enough to work, so I hope even if I don't run with it this time, I'm sure it'll pop up again later...
