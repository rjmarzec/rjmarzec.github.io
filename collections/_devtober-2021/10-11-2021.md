title: Surprise - more art concepting!
---

Another long day for me, so back to programmer art I go!  

Today I messed around with concepting some attacks for the game. Are they going to be magical and physical like a wizard or warrior cupcake, or are they going to be food-based to match with the theme of a cupcake? At the moment, I'm not really sure. Both have their fun ups and downs. As I progress further I should have a better sense of what makes sense for the game, through for now I've got a bunch of temp assets ready to go into the game.
