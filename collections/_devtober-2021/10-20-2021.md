title: Some simple animations
---

Getting back into the swing of things, today I kept it simple and went back to some animation work! Right now the game works and is playable, but it's pretty hard to follow with nothing going on. I went ahead and added some basic popup animations for the attack and heal effects.  

Even for how small they are, I think they bring a lot of fun life to the game, keeping in line with the art style already there. Now it's just about getting more interesting effects in the game and going from there!
