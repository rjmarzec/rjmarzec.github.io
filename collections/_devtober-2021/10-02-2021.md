title: The game is coming together!
---

Today I went off to the races with starting on my Ludum Dare 49 Compo project! I don't think I actually mentioned that last time - I'm running to Ludum Dare as part of the compo, not the regular jam. That means all the programming, art, and music was done by me all on my own! I've been wanting to work on a project solo after doing a bunch of team work as of late, and Ludum Dare was the perfect opportunity for that.  

Anyways, the game! In my down time during my shift at work today, I got started by redrawing all the artwork from the concept. It had a lot of solid parts to draw from, but the artwork had some issues. None of the images were drawn to the scale they would be in game, things weren't as cleanly drawn as they could have been, and I had new ideas for what buildings would end up in game, so that's where the effort went. I'm pretty happy with how cutesy all the buildings turned out, through in practice they're a bit hard to make out all the details of given how smaller they are in game. A lesson for next time I suppose.

After settling back home after work, I got started on the core gameplay, and by the end of the night the gif below is where I was at! I stayed up well past that time working on the game some more, but a day in things were starting to come together even when I was busy and didn't budget time the best. At this point the time I put in was a blur, but by the time I went to bed I got a bunch more work done, setting myself up for tomorrow to finishing balancing, visual flair, and audio. More on that on the post after this one I guess.  

As always, see you tomorrow!
