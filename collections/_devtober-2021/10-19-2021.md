title: Back in action!
---

The past week has been a bit rough - I got stacked with school projects, midterms, and this weekend I was directing MHacks 14, the University of Michigan's annual hackathon. With so much on my plate I had to take a break from Devtober, but I'm glad to have the time to be back again! Since I somehow survived planning and running a Hackathon with my team, I've now got some more free time to breath, and I guess a part of that gets to go back into this month and blog!  

Today I decided to finally sit and work on some actual gameplay - a simple back-and-forth combat showing off the mechanic of building up a list of actions you preform each turn. Only being able to choose between attacking and healing against an enemy that only attacks isn't the most exciting gameplay, but it works! Now it's all about expanding the gameplay and making it look all pretty.

For bare-bones it is now, I think there's potential in expanding on it, so I'm excited to keep working for the rest of this month! We'll see where it manages to end up.

See you tomorrow,
