title: Playing around with lighting and shaders
---

Since I've mostly worked with 2D games in Unity, lighting and shaders are things I don't really have much experience in. So, today I decided to play around with them working with having 2D sprites in a 3D world. Check out the results below:

So far so good I think? The results aren't super crazy since I was following a tutorial, but it's a good start. I'll definitely be looking into this kind of lighting down the line once I hop into working on a title more seriously!  

See you tomorrow,
