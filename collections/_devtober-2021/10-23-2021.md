title: Space and a Library
---

After not being too happy with the cave/mine yesterday, I went back to experimenting with the theme again. After mulling it over for a bit, a space ship and library popped out of my brain, and that's what you see below. I think both ended up looking good, and at least compared to the cave, we've got some big improvement with the drafts here.    

Out of the two, I think the space ship has a lot more room to grow, so expect more on that over the coming days!
