title: Starting something new
---

With Ludum Dare behind me, I'm starting up something new, but I'm taking it a bit slower now that I have some time to breath.  

That next project? A card game! I've been thinking about making one for a while, and the though of committing to working on that idea was what motivated me to start Devtober (on top of the conveniently timed Ludum Dare, which is always a fun time).  

I didn't do anything crazy today - I just got started on a design doc for the game. It turns out that games you plan turn out to be the best, so I thought that would be a fun start to the project. Specifically, I was looking to lay out the turn order of the game so that when I get into the programming I can have a solid plan. A bit more on why I thought that was important later as the project comes together a bit more...  

So today I don't have anything flashy to show off, but I'm really excited about finally getting started on the idea I've had bouncing around in my head for a while now!  

See you tomorrow,  
-Robert
