title: A gameplay loop
---

Devtober is almost over, but I realized I was missing something important: a gameplay loop! Right now, when you beat an enemy, the game just ends instead of letting you have another go. Now, when you win a fight, the cupcake walks off screen and into the next encounter!  

A pretty simple solution, but one that still helps the game feel out a lot. At least now I don't have to pick between the robot and the meteor being the main fight of the game.
